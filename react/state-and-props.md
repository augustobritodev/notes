## What is State?

- State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.
- Whenever the state object changes, the component re-renders
- It is recommended to make state as simple as possible to minimize the number of stateful components
- State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component
- It is not accessible to any other component till the owner component decides to pass i
